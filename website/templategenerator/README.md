# Learnings_from_AeN_template_generator

Learnings from AeN template generator is designed based on experiences gained during the Nansen Legacy project (Arven etter Nansen - AeN). This template generator will be used to create spreadsheet templates that include columns based on both the NetCDF Climate and Forecast (CF) Metadata Conventions and Darwin Core. 

CF Conventions: https://cfconventions.org/
Darwin Core: https://dwc.tdwg.org/

A separate sheet in the same file includes space to fill in metadata based on both the Attribute Convention for Data Discovery (ACDD) and the Ecological Metadata Language (EML).

ACDD: https://wiki.esipfed.org/Attribute_Convention_for_Data_Discovery_1-3
EML: https://eml.ecoinformatics.org/

The ACDD conventions recommendations used in this template generator are in line with the recommendations for CF-NetCDF files that contribute to SIOS, as documented here:
