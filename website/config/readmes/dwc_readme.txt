README:

Spreadsheet template to record metadata and data.

Please do not publish data in this format. This template should make it easier for you to create a Darwin Core Archive.
This will help make your data FAIR.

Most of the column headers in the 'data' sheet are Darwin Core terms.
Use these as column headers in the CSV cores and extensions if creating a Darwin Core Archive.
A list of Darwin Core terms is available here:
https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/

The attributes in the 'metadata' sheet are from the Ecological Metadata Language (EML).
This convention is used in Darwin Core Archives.

You can create a Darwin Core Archive from this file, using GBIF's Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT).
In the link below there is a map of places where this is installed.
Contact a relevant one of these and ask if you can use their node.
They can provide you with login details.
It is also possible to configure a node at your own institution.
